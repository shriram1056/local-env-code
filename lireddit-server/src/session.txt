when thsi code run: req.session.userId = user.id;

{userId: 1} ->this data is sent that to redis


1: in redis, this how things are stored. redis generate a random key for data
sess:qwoeiuowqjoqjw -> { userId: 1 }

2
express-session will set a cookie on my browser qwoieu9012798quw9euoe1i2uo

3
when user makes a request, a cookie is sent to the browser
qwoieu9012798quw9euoe1i2uo -> sent to the server

4
server decrypts the cookie  in redis with the cookie key in server to redis key
qwoieu9012798quw9euoe1i2uo -> sess:qwoeiuowqjoqjw

5
server makes a request to redis
sess:qwoeiuowqjoqjw -> { userId: 1 }

req.session = { userId: 1 }

you need to have redis-server in terminal if you want the initial connection to it.

An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the same server. 

EXPRESS Session

When storing session data in a redis, the server will still use a cookie, but the cookie will only contain a unique sessionId. This sessionId will be used by the server to perform a lookup against the store.
