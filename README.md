# lireddit https://lireddit1056.vercel.app/

made with chakra-ui, express, graphQL and next-js

**with organiztions developing their own internal software for communication, there is a huge need for developer to make them. That inspired me to create this website, which I'm also hoping to use to impress my future boss, no but seriously with minimal changes this project can be converted into a full-fledged blog or voting website.** 

### The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:<br />
> * Building a GraphQL API
> * URQL
> * MVC Architectural Pattern
> * SQL

#### More specifically, I used the following:
> * Dependency injection
> * postgreSQL pgdmin and command line
> * mikroORM (DBContext, Migration)
> * GraphQL (query, mutation, schemas and fragments)
> * HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, status codes)
> * database design 
> * syncing data base model with schema
> * dataloader
> * styled-component library (chakra-UI)  
> * jsx, props, hooks, conditional rendering and custom hooks
> * session management (redis)
